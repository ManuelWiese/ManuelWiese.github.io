# Hello World!

I am programming for almost all my life, but I just recently started learning python...and fell in love with it!
In this series I want to collect my 10.000 hours of python and get insanely good.

I will try to write down a small post everytime I learned something about python.
It might be too basic at first, but i hope everyone can learn something by following this series.

So let's dive into the beautiful world of the python programming language and get insanely good together!
